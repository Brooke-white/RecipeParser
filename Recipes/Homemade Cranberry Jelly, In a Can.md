###Ingredients
|Quantity|Ingredient|
----------:|:-------
||juice of 1/2 a lemon|
|1 1/2|cups sugar|
|1|pinch cloves (optional)|
|1 1/2|teaspoons dry pectin (optional, but recommended)|
|2 1/2|cups cranberries|
|2/3|cup apple cider|
|1/4|teaspoon cinnamon (optional)|
|1/8|teaspoon nutmeg (optional)|

###Instructions

* Place cranberries in a medium saucepan. Mix pectin and spices into the sugar, then add the sugar mixture to the cranberries and stir to combine. Add the cider and lemon juice.

* Cook over medium-high heat, stirring regularly. Once the cranberries have burst and the sauce has thickened, remove the pan from the heat. (If the sauce seems too thick, just add a splash of water or cider to thin it out.)

* Run the sauce through a fine sieve or food mill until all that’s left are the bits of seeds and skins. Pour the strained sauce into an empty can. (It’s best to use a can that’s BPA-free and once held a neutral-tasting food, to avoid imparting any unwanted flavors.) Cover can with foil or plastic wrap and let set in the fridge, for at least 12 hours.

* When it’s time to serve, run a butter knife around the sides of the jelly. If it still doesn’t seem to want to slide out, crack open the bottom of the can with a can opener. (No need to try to take the bottom off—just a little bit of air should take care of the vacuum and let the jelly slide out easily.)
