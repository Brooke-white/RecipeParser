###Ingredients
|Quantity|Ingredient|
----------:|:-------
|2 1/2|cups rolled oats|
|1/2|cup sugar|
|3|cups powdered sugar|
|1|cup unsalted butter (2 sticks)|
|1 1/2|cups unsalted butter (3 sticks), room temperature|
|1/21/4|teaspoon salt|
|2|eggs|
|1|teaspoon baking soda|
|1|cup brown sugar|
|1 1/22|teaspoons vanilla|
|1|tablespoon bourbon|
|3|tablespoons heavy cream|
|2|cups all-purpose flour|
|2|tablespoons molasses|

###Instructions

* Preheat the oven to 350Â° F. Line three half sheet pans with parchment paper.

* In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

* In the bowl of a standing mixer, beat together the butter and sugars until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the molasses, and beat to combine, then add the eggs, and beat to combine. Add the bourbon and vanilla, and mix to combine. (Scrape down the sides as needed through this whole step.)

* Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, and mix on low until completely incorporated. Add the oats and mix on low to combine.Take the bowl off the mixer, and use a spatula to make sure the dough is thoroughly mixed.

* Using a heaping tablespoon to scoop the dough, place the cookies on the prepared baking sheets (I could fit 3 across, and 4 down). Bake the cookies for 8 to 12 minutes, until the edges are golden brown and the center is set. Remove from the oven and let them cool completely on a wire rack. When the cookies are cooled, place the brown butter cream (recipe follows) on the bottom side of one cookie, and top with another (how much you put is completely up to you!).

* Brown 1 cup (2 sticks) of the butter: Melt it in a medium-sized saucepan. You need to stay close to the pan; don't walk away from it. Swirl the butter around until it starts to brown -- it will smell nutty and you'll see little brown bits at the bottom of the pan. Remove the pan from the heat, pour the brown butter and bits into a freezer-safe bowl, and let cool for 10 minutes. When the butter is partially cool, place the bowl in the freezer and let the butter chill until solid, about 30 minutes (you can also put it in the fridge to cool down, but it will take a bit longer). When the butter is solid (but not frozen!), take it out and place it in the bowl of a standing mixer.

* Add the remaining stick of butter to the browned butter in the bowl, and beat all the butter until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Stop the mixer and add the heavy cream, vanilla, and salt, and beat to combine. Slowly add the powdered sugar on low speed. Once it is incorporated, increase the speed to medium and beat the cream until it is smooth and fluffy, 4 to 6 minutes.
