### Ingredients
|Quantity|Ingredient|
----------:|:-------
|2|tablespoons shredded unsweetened coconut|
||zest of 2 limes|
|1/2|cup raw walnuts|
|1|medium avocado|
|1/4|cup coconut oil|
|11|pinch salt|
|5|dates, pitted|
|1/4|cup lime juice|
|1/21/2|teaspoon vanilla extract|
|2|tablespoons raw honey (sub maple syrup to be vegan)|

### Instructions

* Put the crust ingredients into a food processor and pulse until there are no chunks and you are able to mold the mixture in your hands. If itâs not sticking then pulse a few more times or try adding a splash of water. Remove from the food processor and set aside in a bowl. Try not to eat all of it.

* For the filling, put all the of ingredients into your food processor and process until smooth. Taste it and decide whether youâd like it more sweet (add honey) or more tart (add more lime juice).

* Line a muffin tin with 4 muffin cups. Divide the date mixture evenly among the cups and press to create a mini compact crust. Then spoon the filling on to the crust. If you have extra filling then just pour it into another muffin cup for a crustless versionâ¦ or just eat it right then and there with a spoon. Top with a sprinkle of shredded coconut and some lime zest, if desired.

* Place in the freezer for at least a couple of hours or until solid. I like to let them sit out for 10 minutes to soften up a bit, but they are also good straight from the freezer.
