### Ingredients

#### For White Chocolate Buttercream:
* 5 tablespoons (70gr) unsalted butter, softened
* 1/3 cup (50gr) powdered sugar
* ½ cup (70gr) white chocolate chips
* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
* 1-2 teaspoons sprinkles


#### For macaron shells:
* 1 cup (100gr) almond flour
* ¾ cup (100gr) powdered sugar
* 2 large egg whites (about 70gr)
* ¼ teaspoon cream of tartar
* ¼ cup (50gr) granulated sugar
* ½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract
* 2-3 tablespoons sprinkles


### Instructions

* In a medium bowl, sift together almond flour and powdered sugar twice. Set aside.

* In a large mixing bowl with whisk attachment, beat the egg whites on medium speed until foamy. Add cream of tartar and continue to beat. Slowly add sugar one tablespoon at a time. Increase the speed to medium high and beat until hard peaks. Add vanilla extract and beat on medium speed until combined.

* Sift the almond flour/powdered sugar mixture over the whipped egg whites. Gently fold the mixture running the spatula clockwise from the bottom, up around the sides and cut the batter in half, as shown in the video above. The batter will look very thick at first, but it will get thinner as you fold. Be careful not to over mix it though. Every so often test the batter to see if it reached the right consistency. To test the batter, drop a small amount of the batter and count to ten. If the edges of the ribbon are dissolved within ten seconds, then the batter is ready. I repeat, do NOT mix again. If you still see edges, fold the batter couple more times and test again. This step is so crucial, so please make sure to test often to ensure not to over mix the batter. Add the sprinkles (as much as you want) and carefully stir the batter to distribute the sprinkles evenly. Be careful not toover-mixassprinkles will bleed its color into the batter too much.

* Transfer the batter into a pastry bag with a round tip. (I use this Wilton A1 large plain round tip.)

* Pipe out 1.5-inch rounds about an inch apart on two baking sheets lined with parchment paper.

* Tap the baking sheets firmly on the counter a few times to get rid of any air bubbles. If you dont release the air bubbles, they will expand during baking and crack the beautiful macarons shells. And who wants cracked macarons, right? Sprinkle some more sprinkles on top.

* Let the macarons rest and dry for 15-30 minutes. On a humid day, it may take an hour or so. To see if its ready to be baked, lightly touch it. If the batter doesnt stick to your finger, then its ready.

* Preheat the oven to 300F (150C).

* Bake the macarons for 18-20 minutes. To check the doneness, carefully remove one macaron. If the bottom does not stick, they are done.

* Transfer to wire rack to cool for 15 minutes, and then remove from the baking sheets.

* While macarons are drying, prepare the buttercream. In a mixing bowl with whisk attachment, beat the butter and powdered sugar until fluffy, about 2 minutes.

* Melt the white chocolate chips in the microwave according to package directions. (I microwaved mine for 1.5 minutes at 50% power. Stirred and microwaved for another 30 seconds at 50% power. Stirred again and microwaved for 15 seconds at 50% power.)

* Add the melted white chocolate and vanilla extract to the whipped butter mixture. Beat until the filling is smooth and well combined. Stir in sprinkles. Transfer the buttercream into a pastry bag and fill the macarons.

* Store thefilled macarons in airtight containerin thefridgefor up to 5 days. You can also freeze the filled macarons in airtight container for up to 5 months.
