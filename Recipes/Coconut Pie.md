###Ingredients
|Quantity|Ingredient|
----------:|:-------
|3|tablespoons sugar|
|5|tablespoons cornstarch|
|4|egg yolks|
|1/2|teaspoon salt|
|1/2|cup coconut flakes|
|1/4|cup pecans|
|1|tablespoon icing (powdered) sugar|
|1|teaspoon vanilla extract|
|1 1/2|cups whole milk|
|15|ounces can sweetened cream of coconut|
|4|tablespoons melted butter|
|8|graham crackers (one sleeve)|
|1|cup whipping cream|
|1|tablespoon cold butter|

###Instructions

* Start by making a graham cracker crust: Crush the graham crackers and pecans in a food processor (or by hand in a baggie with a rolling pin). Stir in melted butter, press into a pie tin, and bake at 350Â° F for 10 minutes. Then leave the crust to cool.

* To make the coconut custard, start by heating milk and cream of coconut in a saucepan until scalding.

* In a bowl, whisk together yolks, sugar, cornstarch, and salt until pale yellow.

* Carefully temper the yolk mixture by whisking in 1/2 cup of the hot milk mixture. Then, slowly add the remaining milk, whisking continuously until fully combined.

* Pour the custard base back into the saucepan and place over low heat. Whisk continuously until the custard boils and thickens. Then remove from the heat.

* Whisk in the cold butter and vanilla extract. Leave custard to cool to room temperature.

* Pour the cooled custard into the cooled crust and refrigerate until completely chilled, at least 2 hours.

* Toast coconut flakes in a pan over low heat until the edges are golden. Let cool.

* Whip cream with icing sugar until it is thick and spreadable.

* Top the coconut pie with whipped cream and sprinkle on coconut flakes. Slice and serve!
