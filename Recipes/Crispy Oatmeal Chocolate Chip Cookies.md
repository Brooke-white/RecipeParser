### Ingredients
|Quantity|Ingredient|
----------:|:-------
|1|teaspoon baking soda|
|1/4|teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg|
|1|cup packed light brown sugar|
|1/8|teaspoon allspice|
|2|cups semisweet chocolate chips or chunks|
|1|teaspoon vanilla extract|
|1|teaspoon kosher salt|
|1|teaspoon ground cinnamon|
|1 1/4|cups all-purpose flour|
|2|sticks unsalted butter, softened|
|1/2|cup granulated sugar|
|3|cups rolled oats|
|1|large egg|

### Instructions

* Heat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, baking soda and spices. Set aside.

* In the bowl of a standing mixer, cream the butter and two sugars until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla and beat until combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl once. Add the flour and spices in three additions, beating until just combined and scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition. Do not overbeat!

* Stir in the oats and the chocolate chips, distributing evenly. Drop the dough in heaping tablespoons on parchment-lined baking sheets, keeping the cookies at least 2 inches apart. Flatten gently with the back of a spoon and bake for about 10 minutes, rotating the baking sheets halfway through. The cookies are done when they turn lightly golden around the edges, and the tops look almost dry. Cool on the baking sheets for a minute, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely. The cookies are best still slightly warm, but you can successfully store them in an airtight container for up to a few days.
