###Instructions

* Heat a cast-iron skillet or frying pan over medium heat. Add the coriander seeds, cloves, star anise, and cinnamon stick and toast until fragrant, about 3-4 minutes. Immediately spoon out the spices into a bowl to avoid burning them and set aside.

* In a large pot, add the toasted spices and all ingredients from stock through fish sauce and bring to a boil.

* Reduce the heat to medium-low and let simmer for 20 minutes, skimming the surface frequently.

* Taste the broth and add more sugar or fish sauce, if needed. Strain the broth and discard the solids. Add the kale and cook for 1-2 more minutes. Remove from heat.

* Add the shredded turkey and the cellophane noodles. Allow to sit for a few minutes while the noodles soften.

* Ladle the broth into bowls. Divide the kale, shredded turkey and the noodles evenly into each bowl.

* Sprinkle on the garnishes and add sriracha to taste. Squeeze lime juice to taste over the top of your bowl before eating.
