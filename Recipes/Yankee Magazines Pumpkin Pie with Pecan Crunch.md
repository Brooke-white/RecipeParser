###Ingredients
|Quantity|Ingredient|
----------:|:-------
||Whipped cream for serving (optional)|
||Pinch of salt|
|1/2|cup light brown sugar|
|2|tablespoons heavy cream|
|1|tablespoon dark rum or bourbon|
|3|lightly beaten eggs|
|3|tablespoons melted butter|
|1/2|cup half-and-half|
|1/2|teaspoon each cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger|
|1|fully baked 9-inch pie shell (we used Erin McDowell's All-Buttah Pie Crust, also on Food52)|
|1/4|cup granulated sugar|
|1/2|cup pecan halves (optional)|
|1|cup chopped pecans|
|2|cups pumpkin puree|

###Instructions

* Combine filling ingredients and pour into pre-baked shell. Bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes. Turn heat down to 325 degrees and continue to bake until set, about 40 minutes more. Pie is ready when a knife blade inserted 1-1/2 inches in from the edge emerges clean. The center of the pie may still quiver gently. Place on a rack and let cool completely.

* Shortly before serving, heat broiler. Combine brown sugar, butter, cream, and chopped nuts and spread over pie. Optionally: Decorate with pecan halves (be sure to nestle them down into the brown sugar mixture). Protect crust rim with a ring of foil and place pie about 6 inches below broiler. Keep oven door ajar. Broil, turning frequently, for about 5 minutes or until topping is dark brown and bubbly (watch carefully!). Again let cool. Serve with whipped cream if desired.
