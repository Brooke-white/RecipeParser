|Ingredients|
| ------------- |
|2 cups peeled and cored pineapple rings (about 10 rings)|
|1 red bell pepper, seeded|
|1 small (190 g) red onion, halved|
|1 jalapeno, seeded|
|2 tomatoes|
|1 clove garlic|
|¼ tsp salt|
|¼ tsp cumin|

### Instructions

* Light up the grill (or a panini grill) and cook the pineapple, bell pepper, onion, and jalapeno over medium/high heat until slightly charred, 5 to 10 minutes.

* For chunky salsa, roughly chop all fruits and veggies and toss with seasoning. For less chunky salsa, throw everything in a food processor and blitz a few times until it reaches a consistency to your liking.

* Cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.
