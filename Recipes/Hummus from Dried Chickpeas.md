###Ingredients
|Ingredient|
|:-------|
|1  lb  dried garbanzo beans, soaked overnight|
|1  cup  tahini|
|3/4 cup  lemon juice|
|1/2 cup  olive oil|
|6 -8    garlic cloves, peeled|
|1 -2  tablespoon  salt, to taste|
|1  teaspoon  ground cumin (optional)|

###Instructions

* Bring chickpeas to boiling then simmer about 1/2 hour until tender. 

* Drain chickpeas, reserving liquid. Let stand until cool enough to handle. (Using warm to hot chickpeas makes it possible to process a softer  texture that will then stiffen to a nice, spreadable paste).

* Process in blender or food processor in 2-3 batches according to the size/capability of your equipment. Use enough of the chickpea cooking liquid to get a texture like soft peanut butter.

* Mix the batches together in a large bowl. 

* Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. (If you need more garlic return a half batch to the blender, process it smooth, and stir back into the rest).

* Pack in freezer containers of an appropriate size for your household.

* Tip -- This makes a nice hostess gift when attractively packaged.

* Tip -- Tahini often separates in the can or jar. Rather than trying to mix it in the can then measure it just put the whole can/jar into the blender, whip it up, and pour back the excess.
