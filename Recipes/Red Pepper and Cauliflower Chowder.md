###Ingredients
|Quantity|Ingredient|
----------:|:-------
|1|cup milk (you should probably have some fat in there; I'm a staunch skim milker and even I sprung for 2%)|
|2|cups cauliflower, chopped|
|1|clove garlic, minced (a GLOVE, Iâ€™m trying so hard to make that happen)|
|1/4|teaspoon coriander|
|1|tablespoon olive oil|
|1/4|teaspoon cumin|
|1|bay leaf|
||Grated Parmesan|
|2|cups vegetable stock|
|1|potato, peeled and diced|
|1|red pepper, cored and diced|
||Freshly ground pepper|
|1/2|teaspoon salt|

###Instructions

* Heat olive oil over medium heat. Add garlic and red pepper, cooking down until the pepper is softened, 8 to 10 minutes.

* Add potato, cauliflower, stock, milk, bay leaf, salt, and spices. Bring to a boil and then lower heat to a simmer, cooking for 10 to 15 minutes or until the potato and cauliflower are softened. Stir occasionally, and mash the chunks a little with the back of your wooden spoon.

* Ladle about 2/3 of the vegetable chunks and a little bit of broth into a blender and 
blend until smooth. Be careful! This is hot! Duh. Return the blended soup to the pot 
and stir into the mix until combined, heating through again if it needs it.

* Serve the soup with a hit of black pepper and a pinch of Parmesan on top.
