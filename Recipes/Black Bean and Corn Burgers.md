### Ingredients
|Quantity|Ingredient|
----------:|:-------
|1|teaspoon sea salt|
|1/2|teaspoon smoked paprika|
|1|small yellow onion, chopped|
|1|tablespoon olive oil|
|1 1/2|teaspoons cumin powder|
|2/3|cup quick oats or bread crumbs, plus extra as needed|
||Black pepper or red pepper flakes, to taste|
|1|teaspoon chili powder|
|3/4|cup fresh (or frozen and thawed) corn|
|1|clove garlic, minced|
|3|cups (or 2 cans) cooked black beans, divided|

### Instructions

* Sauté onion and garlic in the olive oil for eight to ten minutes, or until golden, soft, and fragrant.

* Add 2 cups of the beans, the cumin, the paprika, the chili powder, the sea salt, and pepper to taste. Stir in the sauté pan till all is warm.

* Preheat your oven to 350° F.

* Add the oats to the bowl of a food processor and pulse them a few times. Add the onion, garlic, and bean mixture. Process everything together, until it's well combined but still has texture.

* Transfer mixture to a mixing bowl. Add the last cup of black beans and the corn and mix well with your hands. Check for seasoning and season to taste. If the mixture is too mushy to form into patties, add a little more oats or bread crumbs.

* Shape mixture into four large or six smaller patties. Transfer burgers to a baking sheet and bake for 30 to 35 minutes (or until golden), flipping once through. Alternately, you can chill them for twenty minutes before transferring them to a grill and cooking through. You can also pan fry them in olive oil until golden on each side.
