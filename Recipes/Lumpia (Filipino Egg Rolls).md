### Ingredients
|Quantity|Ingredient|
----------:|:-------
|1/2|small onion, finely chopped|
|1|pound ground pork|
|1/3|cup soy sauce|
|2|cloves of garlic, minced|
|1|package square wonton wrappers|
|1/3|cup minced carrots (optional)|
|1/2|cup vegetable oil, using more/less as needed|
|1|teaspoon sugar|
|1/4|cup minced bok choy (optional)|
|1|tablespoon rice wine vinegar|
|2|teaspoons black pepper|
|1|teaspoon salt|

### Instructions

* Make the lumpia filling by placing all of the chopped vegetables, soy sauce, rice vinegar, pepper, salt, and sugar in a medium-sized bowl. Stir well to combine, and then add pork. Mix to ensure that all ingredients are evenly combined. 

Editors' note: We par-cooked the filling. To do this, brown the meat mixture lightly in a pan over medium heat, until it's no longer pink, about 6 to 7 minutes. (No need to add any oil to the pan.) Set aside to cool. When cool, proceed with step 2. (This will make the pork a bit crumbly and the lumpia harder to roll—but this way, you won't have to pan-fry them as long, ensuring you don't burn them.)

* Fill a small ramekin with room temperature water and set aside. Open the package of wonton wrappers and set up work station using a cutting board or other clean surface for assembly. To roll, place a very small amount of filling to the far left side of wonton wrapper (approximately 2 teaspoons) and tightly roll it toward you. (Editors' note: We didn't fold the edges.) Seal the rolled end by brushing the wrapper with water and pressing down. Continue rolling until you're out of filling! (You may have some leftover wonton wrappers.)

* Heat a large pan on medium heat, and coat pan with vegetable oil (about 2 tablespoons or more, depending on the size of your pan). Once oil is hot, place 6 to 7 rolled lumpia on the pan. Be careful not to overcrowd the pan. If you didn't par-cook the filling, cook lumpia for approximately 4 to 6 minutes on one side before flipping to the other side; if you did par-cook, 2 to 3 minutes should do the trick. The cooked side should be golden brown and crispy. Once flipped to the other side, add more oil if needed, and cook for another 4 to 5 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy. Filling should be cooked all the way inside.

* Serve with a dipping sauce of your choice. We've used a sweet and sour pre-made sauce, or a simple sauce made with soy sauce, vinegar, and minced garlic.
