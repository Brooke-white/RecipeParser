|Ingredients|
| ------------- |
|1 medium pineapple|
|2 Tbsp honey (or maple syrup for vegan option)|
|1 Tbsp lime juice|
|4 Tbsp unsweetened shredded coconut|
|Recommended for serving: coconut ice cream or sorbet|

###Instructions

* Cut the pineapple into Â¾ inch slabs, leaving the skin on as decoration or cutting it off (completely up to you!)

* Whisk together honey and lime juice in a bowl. Brush onto each side of the pineapple slabs.

* Heat either a grill or grill skillet to medium heat and grease well. Cook pineapples for about 3 minutes on each side, or until char lines develop, increasing heat if necessary.

* Transfer to serving plates, sprinkle with shredded coconut, and top with a scoop of coconut ice cream. Serve immediately.
