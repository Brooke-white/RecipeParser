|4|cups vegetable or chicken stock, preferably homemade|
|3|tablespoons olive oil|
|1|15 oz. can of cooked chickpeas, preferably organic|

|1|cup kale, chopped fine|
|2|slices preservative-free, all-natural bacon, chopped into small pieces|

|2|large cloves of garlic, minced|
|1|tablespoon olive oil|

|1|leek, trimmed and sliced thinly|

###Instructions

* Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the bacon pieces and cook for a couple of minutes, until they start to brown.

* Add 2 more tablespoons of oil along with the chopped onion, garlic and leek. Continue to cook, strirring occasionally, over medium heat until softened.

* Add the chopped carrot, celery, zucchini, potato and stir around for a minute or two.

* Add the stock, the chickpeas, and then the tomatoes, crushing them with your hands as you go. Add a few generous pinches of salt (be judicious if your stock is salted already). Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 30-40 minutes, until the potatoes are just tender.

* Add the kale and the tortellini, and continue to cook over a simmer until both are tender and cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. Taste and add more salt if necessary. Serve garnished with a spoonful of the pesto, a few drops of the aged balsamic, and a generous sprinkling of grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.

* Chop, chop, and chop the basil or parsley some more by hand until it's very fine...when you do this, you'll reduce it down to about 1/4 cup.

* As you chop the basil, start to incorporate the other ingredients and chop them fine, too, until you have a lovely, finely chopped pesto.

* Transfer to a small bowl and stir in the olive oil. Use as a  garnish for the minestrone.
