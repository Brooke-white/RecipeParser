|Ingredients|
| ------------- |
|2 Tbsp hoisin sauce|
|1 Tbsp low sodium soy sauce|
|2 Tbsp orange juice|
|1 tsp fresh grated ginger|
|6 large carrots, trimmed|
|Water|
|1 Tbsp sesame oil|
|1 Tbsp sesame seeds|

###Instructions

* In a small bowl mix hoisin, soy, orange juice, and ginger.

* Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add carrots to soften them slightly, about 30 seconds. Remove from water and let sit until cool enough to handle.

* Place fat end of carrot into the spiralizer, using the largest noodle cut size your spiralizer has. Spin spin spin away until you get about 3 inches from the bottom (too hard to get that last bit, dont try!)

* Heat sesame oil in a large saute pan or a wok over medium heat.

* Add carrot noodles and cook about 3 minutes, stirring and flipping it all about like the true chef you are.

* Add in the sauce mixture and continue to cook another 3 minutes or so minutes, stirring to blend everything together.

* Sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve hot!
