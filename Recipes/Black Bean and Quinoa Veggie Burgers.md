###Instructions

* Place the quinoa in a small saucepan along with 1 cup of water.  Bring the water to a boil then reduce heat to medium low and cover the pan.  Cook 10 to 15 minutes until the water is absorbed and quinoa is cooked. Remove from heat.

* Heat the oil in a small sauté pan over medium heat and add the onion and garlic.  Season them with a pinch of salt and sauté until onions are softened, 5 to 6 minutes. Place the mixture into a large bowl. Add approximately 1 1/2 cans of black beans to the bowl and, using a potato masher or fork, mash all of the ingredients together until a pasty mixture forms. Stir in the remaining beans along with the tomato paste, egg, corn, cilantro, chipotles, cumin, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Stir in the cooked quinoa and ground oats until evenly distributed.

* Form the mixture into 6 equal patties, compacting them well with your hands as you form them. Place the patties on a baking sheet, cover them with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least a few hours or overnight.

* To make the yogurt sauce, stir the yogurt, chipotles, adobo sauce, honey, and mustard together in a small bowl.

* When ready to eat, preheat the oven to 400° F.  Spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray and place the patties on the sheet. Cook 10 to 12 minutes, until the patties are golden brown and crispy, then carefully flip them over and cook another 10 minutes. You can also fry the patties in a pan with a small amount of oil. Serve patties on the buns with the yogurt sauce and toppings of your choice.
