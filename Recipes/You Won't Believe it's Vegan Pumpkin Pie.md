### Instructions

* Prepare one perfect vegan pie crust. You can find the recipe here: http://food52.com/recipes/19559_perfect_vegan_pie_crust.

* Roll the crust out to 1/4 inch thickness and line a greased and floured pie pan. Pinch edges decoratively.

* Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

* Blend all pie filling ingredients in a food processor till super smooth. The mixture should be quite thick, but if it's too thick you can thin it with a tablespoon or two of water or non dairy milk. Spoon into the crust, smooth over, and bake until the edges of the crust are golden brown and the filling is dark (35 to 40 minutes). Let cool for a while before serving.
