### Ingredients
|Quantity|Ingredient|
----------:|:-------
|1 1/4|cups dark chocolate chips (we prefer chocolate with 60 percent cocoa content or higher—double-check the ingredients if you want to make sure they're vegan)|
|1/2|cup plus 1 tablespoon canola, grapeseed, or any other neutral oil|
|3/4|teaspoon baking soda|
|1/4|cup plus 1 tablespoon water|
|1/2|cup (100 grams) sugar|
||Coarse-grained sea salt or flaky sea salt like Maldon, for garnish|
|2|cups (250 grams) all-purpose flour|
|1/2|teaspoon fine salt|
|1/2|cup (110 grams) packed light or dark brown sugar|
|1|teaspoon baking powder|

### Instructions

* In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the chocolate chips to the flour mixture and toss to coat.

* In a separate large bowl, whisk the sugars briskly with the canola oil and water until smooth and incorporated, about 2 minutes. Note: Use fresh, soft light brown sugar. If there are clumps, break them up with the back of a spoon or your hand before whisking.

* Add the flour mixture to the sugar mixture, and then stir with a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula until just combined and no flour is visible. Do not overmix.

* Cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours. Do not skip this step.

* Preheat the oven to 350° F. Line two rimmed sheet pans with parchment paper. Remove dough from the refrigerator and use an ice cream scoop or a spoon to portion dough into 2-inch mounds. We recommend freezing the balls of dough for 10 minutes before baking as the cookies will retain their shape better while baking.

* Sprinkle the balls of dough with coarse-grained sea salt (if freezing, remove balls of dough from the freezer first), and bake for 12 to 13 minutes, or until the edges are just golden. Do not overbake.

* Let cool completely before serving.
