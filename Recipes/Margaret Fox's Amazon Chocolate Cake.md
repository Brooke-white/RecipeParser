###Ingredients
|Quantity|Ingredient|
----------:|:-------
||Confectioners' sugar (optional, for dusting)|
|1|teaspoon baking soda|
|5|tablespoons neutral oil (like corn, canola, or vegetable)|
|1|cup cold water|
|1/3|cup unsweetened cocoa|
|1|tablespoon cider or white vinegar|
|1 1/2|teaspoons vanilla|
|1 1/2|cups all-purpose flour|
|1/2|teaspoon salt|
|1|cup sugar|

###Instructions

* Heat the oven to 350Â° F.

* Mix together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, sugar, and salt. Sift. In a separate bowl, whisk together the water, oil, vanilla, and vinegar.

* Whisk together the wet and dry mixtures. If lumpy, whisk until smooth, or pour through strainer in to a bowl and break up lumps, pressing them through.

* Mix again, and pour into a greased 9-inch round cake pan. Tap the edge of the pan against the edge of the counter, or drop from 6 inches to the floor several times to pop air bubbles. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the top springs back when pressed gently.

* Cool before removing from the pan and dusting with confectioners' sugar, or frosting if desired.
