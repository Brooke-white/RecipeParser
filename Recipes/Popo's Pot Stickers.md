### Ingredients
|Quantity|Ingredient|
----------:|:-------
|2|tablespoons soy sauce|
|2|tablespoons ginger, minced|
|1|teaspoon salt|
|4 to 5|garlic cloves, minced|
|1|cup green chives, minced (or green onions)|
|2|tablespoons sesame oil|
|2|teaspoons ground Sichuan peppercorns (or white pepper)|
|1|egg|
|2|teaspoons cornstarch|
|1|package round gyoza/pot sticker wrappers|
|1|pound ground pork|
|1|cup cilantro, minced|

### Instructions

* In a large mixing bowl, combine pork with ginger, cilantro, garlic, chives, salt, and pepper. In another bowl, whisk together egg, sesame oil, soy sauce, and cornstarch. Mix this into the pork mixture with your hands, making sure it's well combined.

* Make sure your wrappers are completely defrosted before starting. Have a small dish of water nearby. Put one wrapper at a time one a clean working surface and place a scant teaspoon of filling in the middle. Using your fingers, dampen the edge of the wrapper and fold it into a half-moon. Push the edges together tightly; you may also decoratively crimp the edges if you like. Repeat until finished (with or without child labor!).

* Dumplings can be fried, baked or boiled, but the traditional Cantonese method for cooking pot stickers is a hybrid of frying and steaming. Heat a large non-stick skillet on medium high and lightly coat the bottom with oil. Place about 20 or so pot stickers in a tight circle, flat side-down. Allow them to sizzle in the pan for about 1 minute then add about a half cup of water. Cover immediately, as it will splatter. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until you can see the moisture inside the dumplings boiling, about 10 minutes. Remove lid and increase heat to medium high. Allow the water to boil off and the bottoms to brown, about 5 minutes. Gently unstick the stickers with a spatula. Invert a plate over the pan then flip the whole circle of pot stickers onto the plate, browned side-up. Popo would serve these with a simple dipping sauce of equal parts soy sauce and vinegar, but they're great plain, too.

* You can freeze any extras before cooking them. You can use the same method to cook them from frozen, but it might take about 5 minutes longer.
