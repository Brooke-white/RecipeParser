### Ingredients
|Quantity|Ingredient|
----------:|:-------
|1/2-1|teaspoons kosher salt|
|1-2|tablespoons olive oil|
|12|small to medium Brussels Sprouts|
|1|teaspoon lemon zest (optional)|
|1/2-1|teaspoons celery salt|
|1/2-1|teaspoons cracked black pepper|
|1|tablespoon parmesan cheese grated or shreded (optional)|
|1|handful crumbled bacon (optional)|
|1/2-1|teaspoons garlic powder|
|1/2-1|teaspoons onion powder|

### Instructions

* First, clean the sprouts.  Trim the cut ends back without interferring with the leaves, and peel any withered leaves off the bulb.  Score the bottoms; one cut will suffice.

* Then place the sprouts in boiling, salted water for no more than five minutes.  NO MORE!

* Drain, drizzle with oil and toss in a bowl with the salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and celery salt.

* When the sprouts are nice and coated, place on a hot grill (but keep the bowl handy), turning every four minutes for a total of twelve minutes.

* Remove from the grill back to the seasoning bowl and toss to coat with any remaining seasoning.

* If desired, add any or all of the remaining three ingredients (bacon, lemon zest, parmesan cheese)
