### Ingredients

#### For Pastry Shells:
* ½ cup (125gr) milk (whole, 2%, or 1% will work)
* ½ cup (125gr) water
* 1/2 cup (115gr) unsalted butter
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* 1 cup (125gr) all-purpose flour
* 4-5 large eggs, at room temperature


#### For Pastry Cream:
* 2 cups (500gr) milk
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 4 egg yolks
* 1/3 cup (70gr) sugar
* 2 tablespoons flour
* 2 tablespoons cornstarch
* 1/2 cup (120 ml) cold heavy whipping cream


#### For Chocolate Ganache:
* ½ cup (120ml) heavy whipping cream
* 1 cup (175gr) semi-sweet chocolate chips
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter,softened, optional


### Instructions

* Preheat oven to 375F (190C).

* To make the pastry shells: In a medium saucepan, boil milk, water, butter, sugar and salt on high heat. When the milk mixture is boiling, add the flour all at once, reduce the heat to medium and continuously mix everything. The dough will start to form into a ball. Keep mixing for another 3-4 minutes until light crust forms on the bottom of the pan.

* Transfer the dough into a mixing bowl with paddle attachment and mix it for a few minutes on low speed until the mixture is at room temperature. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. This will help to get egg absorbed into the dough quicker. Dont add more than 2 eggs at a time. This is important, as you might not need to add all the eggs. The dough should be smooth and thin enough to fall into a ribbon, but toorunny.

* Transfer the batter into a pastry bag and pipe into 4-inch strips 3 inches apart. Level peaked tops with wet fingertip.

* Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the shells are puffed up and golden brown, rotating the sheets top to bottom and back to front once after first 15 minutes. When you take the clairs out, it should stay puffed. If it falls flat, put it back in the oven, bake for additional 3-5 minutes, turn the oven off and let it cool in the warm oven. Once cooled, make a small slit on the sides, or on the bottom of the eclairs.

* To make the pastry cream: In a small bowl, mix together flour and cornstarch. Set aside.

* In a medium saucepan, bring the milk and vanilla extract to a boil. Once it boils, turn the heat off.

* In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks with sugar until pale.Stir inflour mixture.To temper the egg yolk mixture, add about ½ cup of hot milk, while stirring vigorously.Add the tempered egg mixture back into the remaining milk. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until it thickens, about 5-7 minutes.

* Transfer to a clean bowl and set it over ice bath to cool. Cover with plastic wrap so that it touches the cream and refrigerate it.

* Whip heavy cream till hard peaks form. Fold in the whipped cream to the pastry cream and mix until well combined. Transfer the filling into a pastry bag with a small round tip and fill the pastry shells.

* To make the chocolate ganache:In small saucepan, bring heavy cream to a simmer. Do not boil.Pour hot cream over chocolate chips, and let it sit for good 2 minutes.Then mix well until smooth for couple minutes.Stir in butter to add some shine. Dip each eclair in the chocolate ganache and serve.
