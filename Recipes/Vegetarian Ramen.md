###Ingredients
|Quantity|Ingredient|
----------:|:-------
|2|tablespoons bonito flakes (technically not vegetarian, but recommended for fish eaters)|
|4|packets ramen or udon noodles, preferably fresh|
|1|cup shoyu (Japanese soy sauce)|
|1|tablespoon oil with high smoke point, like peanut|
|1 to 2|squirts sriracha, or pinch of red pepper flakes|
||Thai basil|
|1/2|cup mirin|
||Green onion, sliced|
|4|eggs|
|1|sheet kombu, wiped with a damp cloth|
|2|stalks lemongrass, cut into thirds and smashed (optional)|
|6 to 8|garlic cloves, smashed|
|1|onion, cut in half (you can leave the skin on)|
|1|packet extra-firm tofu, pressed of its moisture|
|2|carrots, cut into thirds|
|2|tablespoons brown sugar|
||Lime wedges|
|2|stalks celery, cut into thirds|
|1|cup dried mushrooms, preferably shiittake|
|8|cups cold water|
|One|2-inch section of ginger, smashed|

###Instructions

* Add mushrooms, carrots, onion, celery, garlic, ginger, and lemongrass (if using) into a large stock pot along with 8 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer. Add in kombu and bonito flakes, if using. Simmer stock for 2 to 3 hours.

* Pour stock into a bowl through a fine mesh strainer. (I recommend reserving the mushy, cooked carrots for snacking.) Return stock to the pot.

* Add in soy sauce, mirin, brown sugar, and Sriracha. Stir. Taste for seasoning: Add more soy sauce if you want it saltier, more Sriracha for spice, more brown sugar for sweetness. If the flavor is too strong, add in more water to dilute. Play around until you have a flavorful, balanced broth. Turn down the heat to keep it warm while you prepare your other ingredients.

* Boil a large pot of water with a pinch of salt. Cook eggs to desired doneness -- I like mine cooked for 6 minutes so the yolk is nice and gooey in the middle. Remove eggs from water, keeping it simmering for ramen noodles. Cool eggs, peel, and drop gently into the broth while you prep the rest of your ingredients.

* Slice drained tofu thinly. Heat oil in a wok or non-stick skillet until smoking, then layer in the tofu, making sure none are overlapping. Cook for a minute or two until brown on the underside, then flip and cook for another two minutes. Drain tofu on paper towels.

* Drop noodles into boiling salted water and cook according to package directions. Drain.

* Divide broth between four bowls, then divvy up noodles, eggs (I cut them in half before serving), and fried tofu into broth. Garnish with Thai basil, green onions, and squeezes of lime. Slurp away.

* If you want an even heartier bowl of vegetarian ramen, consider adding roasted vegetables like sweet potatoes, eggplant, or tomatoes. Cube them, then roast in a 425Â° F oven with salt and pepper until wrinkled, soft, and caramelized, then add to broth.
