### Instructions

* Toss tofu, corn starch, orange peel, sea salt & cracked pepper together in a bowl & set aside.

* Whisk together vinegar, brown sugar, oj & pepper; & set aside

* In a large pan over medium high heat, cook tofu in in oils for 4-5 minutes or until the tofu begins to turn golden. Add scallions, ginger, garlic & optional chili & continue to cook for 2-3 minutes. Pour in the vinegar & sugar mixture & cook until the liquid has reduced about half & begins to look a bit sticky (3-4 minutes). Add tamari & sesame seeds & cook for another minute.
