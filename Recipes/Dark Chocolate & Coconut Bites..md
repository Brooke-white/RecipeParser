###Ingredients
|Quantity|Ingredient|
----------:|:-------
||a pinch of sea salt (if your peanut butter is not salted)|
||1 1/4 cup of unsweetened shredded coconut (desiccated), + more rolling, but this is optional|
||1/3 cup maple syrup|
||1/2 cup natural peanut butter (I used chunky, but smooth would be fine too)|
||3 tablespoons cocoa powder|
||1/2 cup good quality semi-sweet chocolate chips or 4oz dark chocolate, chopped|
||1 teaspoon pure vanilla|

###Instructions

* In a medium sized pot, over medium low heat, melt chocolate, pb, syrup, cocoa, vanilla & sea salt. Once the everything is melted and combined (about 3-4 minutes), take off the heat & stir in the coconut.

* It will be a bit thick. Let it cool for a minute. Then, using your hands form TBL sized balls. If you want, you can roll in extra coconut. I like it either way, Jediah prefers it without...so you decide.

* Cool in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes. Keep stored in the refrigerator in an air tight container.
