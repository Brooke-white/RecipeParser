###Ingredients
|Quantity|Ingredient|
----------:|:-------
|2|tablespoons roughly chopped fresh parsley|
|2|large heads cauliflower|
|1/2|teaspoon coarse salt, divided|
||Zest of 1 lemon|
|1/4|cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided|
|2|cloves garlic, finely minced|
|1/2|cup panko (Japanese bread crumbs)|
|1/4|teaspoon freshly ground black pepper|

###Instructions

* Preheat oven to 425°F.

* Trim tough stem and core from cauliflower and discard. Using a paring knife, cut cauliflower into smaller spears. Place in a large bowl. Add 1/4 cup oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper; toss to combine.

* Spread cauliflower out on 2 large, rimmed baking sheets. Roast until edges start to brown, about 20 minutes, stirring halfway through.

* Meanwhile, heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add panko and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and stir to coat in oil. Cook, stirring constantly, until bread crumbs are golden. Add lemon zest and garlic and toss until mixture is very fragrant and bread crumbs are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Place in a medium bowl and add parsley, stirring to combine. Set aside.

* Remove cauliflower from oven and place on serving platter. Top with bread crumbs and serve immediately.
