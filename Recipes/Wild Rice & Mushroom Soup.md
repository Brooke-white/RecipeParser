----------:|:-------
|3/4|cup wild rice or wild rice mix|
|1|tablespoon salt|
|1|ounce shiitake mushroom, dried|
|5|tablespoons butter|
|4|ounces bacon finely chopped|
|1|leek, halved, rinsed and the white & green parts thinly sliced|
|8|ounces button mushrooms, finely chopped|
|2|tablespoons flour|
|4|cups chicken broth|
|1/2|cup dry white wine|
|2/3|cup heavy cream|
|3|tablespoons flat leaf parsley, minced|
|1/2|teaspoon pepper|
### Instructions

* Put wild rice, salt, and 8 cups of cold water in a medium pot. Bring to a boil, lower heat to maintain a steady simmer, and cook until rice in tender, about 45 minutes. Drain and set aside.
* Meanwhile, put shiitake in a small bowl and pour in 1 1/2 cups boiling water. Let sit until soft, about 15 minutes.
* In a large pot, cook 1-tablespoon butter and the bacon over medium heat until the bacon renders some of its fat and turns a light brown. Add button mushrooms and leek. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms give off their liquid, about 10 minutes.
* Meanwhile, lift shiitake from liquid with a slotted spoon (reserving liquid) and finely chop, and add to pot.
* Sprinkle vegetables and bacon with flour and cook, stirring constantly, until flour starts to sink to the bottom of the pot (scrape it up as much as possible while stirring).
* Add wine, reserved liquid from soaking shiitake (pouring slowly so as to leave any grit behind) and broth. Bring to a steady simmer and cook 15 minutes.
* Meanwhile, combine the remaining 4-tablespoons butter, parsley, and pepper. Set aside.
* Add reserved wild rice to vegetable mix and cook 10 minutes. Stir in cream and cook until hot, about 1 minute.
* Divide soup among 8 bowls and dollop of parsley butter on each serving.
