###Ingredients

####
* 1 medium head cauliflower
* 1 tablespoon cream cheese, softened
* 1/4 cup grated Parmesan
* 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
* 1/8 teaspoon straight chicken base or bullion (may substitute 1/2 teaspoon salt)
* 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh or dry chives, for garnish
* 3 tablespoons unsalted butter


###Instructions
* Set a stockpot of water to boil over high heat.
* Clean and cut cauliflower into small pieces. Cook in boiling water for about 6 minutes, or until well done. Drain well; do not let cool and pat cooked cauliflower very dry between several layers of paper towels.
* In a bowl with an immersion blender, or in a food processor, puree the hot cauliflower with the cream cheese, Parmesan, garlic, chicken base, and pepper until almost smooth.
* Garnish with chives, and serve hot with pats of butter.
* Hint: Try roasting the garlic and adding a little fresh
* rosemary for a whole new taste.
