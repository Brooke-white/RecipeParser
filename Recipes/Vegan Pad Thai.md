### Instructions

* Cook the pad thai noodles according to package instructions (this may involve soaking them for a while, so make sure to allot the proper amount of time). Toss them with a teaspoon of sesame oil to prevent too much sticking, and then allow them to cool.

* Whisk or blend together together the almond butter, tamarind paste, the remaining teaspoon of sesame oil, 2 tablespoons of tamari, maple syrup, sriracha, lime juice, and water. Set aside.

* Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the tofu and cook until it's browning on each side (8 to 10 minutes), splashing it as you go with the remaining tablespoon of tamari. Set tofu aside and reduce heat slightly.

* Add the garlic and ginger to the skillet (and a little extra oil if needed). Cool till the garlic is fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the carrots and onions, and cook until the carrots are softened but still crisp (3 minutes or so). Add the noodles and the tofu to the bowl, along with a cup of the sauce. Stir fry the noodles till they're creamy and warm. Add more sauce as you go along, as needed, so that it's well coated. At the very end, stir in the mung bean sprouts, just until they're warm.

* Divide the noodles onto four plates. Sprinkle with cilantro and peanuts and garnish with lime, if desired. Serve.
