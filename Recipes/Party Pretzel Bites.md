###Ingredients
|Quantity|Ingredient|
----------:|:-------
|3 1/2|cups all purpose flour (plus more for dusting surfaces, etc.)|
||fleur de sel|
|3/4|cup warm water (around 105F)|
|3/4|tablespoon active dry yeast|
|3/4|teaspoon salt|
|2|tablespoons sugar|
|1|egg white, for egg wash|
|1/4|cup butter, melted|
|1/4|cup honey|
|2|eggs, beaten|
|1/4|cup baking soda|
|8|cups water|

###Instructions

* In a large bowl stir together the warm water and honey.  Sprinkle with yeast and let stand until the yeast is foamy (about 5 minutes).  Stir in the butter, salt, and eggs.

* Stir in the flour until it is entirely incorporated and it comes together in a shaggy ball.  Turn out the dough onto a floured surface and knead it for several minutes, until smooth.  Put in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a cloth and let rise in a warm place until it rises and collapses (90 minutes - 2 hours)

* Punch the dough down, and on a floured surface roll it out into 8 ropes, each about 3/4 of an inch wide.  Cut the ropes into 1 inch pieces, separate them from each other placing them on a tray or baking sheet and cover with a towel.  Allow to rise for 30 minutes.

* Preheat oven to 425F.  Bring a large pot filled with 8 cups of water to a boil.  Once it is boiling, stir in 2 Tbs. sugar and 1/4 cup baking soda.  It will bubble up like crazy!  But then it will subside.  Turn the heat down to a simmer and add your little dough pieces about ten at a time.  Let them simmer for about a minute and a half, giving them a couple little stirs during the process to make sure both sides cook.  Remove from water with a slotted spoon and put onto a parchment lined baking sheet.

* Repeat until all the little dough bites have been cooked in the water and have been placed onto baking sheets.  You can squeeze on a lot per sheet, as long as they have a little space between them.  Brush the bites with egg white and sprinkle with fleur de sel.

* Bake in the oven for about 15 minutes, until they are a deep chestnut brown.  Remove onto cooling racks immediately to cool.  These pretzel bites are best eaten the day they are baked (very best fresh baked, of course), so I guess you'll have to do it the morning or afternoon of the party!

* Serve with a little bowl of mustard, blue cheese dip (1 cup crumbled blue cheese whisked with 1/2 cup mascarpone), or chocolate fondue.
