12 Pretzels
###Ingredients
|Quantity|Ingredient|
----------:|:-------
|4|teaspoons active dry yeast|
|1|teaspoon white sugar|
|1 1/4|cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)|
|5|cups all-purpose flour|
|1/2|cup white sugar|
|1 1/2|teaspoon salt|
|1|tablespoon vegetable oil|
|1/2|cup baking soda, for baking soda solution|
|4|cups hot water, for baking soda solution|
|1/4|cup kosher salt, for topping|

###Instructions

* In a small bowl, dissolve yeast and 1-teaspoon sugar in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
* In a large bowl, mix together flour, 1/2 cup sugar, and salt. Make a well in the center; add the oil and yeast mixture. Mix and form into a dough. If the mixture is dry, add one or two tablespoons of water. Knead the dough until smooth, about 7 to 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
* Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). In a large bowl, dissolve baking soda in hot water.
* When risen, turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 12 equal pieces. Roll each pieces into a rope and twist into a pretzel shape. Once all the dough is all shaped, dip each pretzel into the baking soda solution and place on a greased baking sheet. Sprinkle with kosher salt.
* Bake in pre-heated oven for 8 minutes, until browned.
