### Ingredients
|Quantity|Ingredient|
----------:|:-------
|6|cups cold water|
|1|ounce dried shitakes (or a handful of fresh shitakes or Maitakes)|
|1|leek, washed and sliced|
|1-2|chopped scallions|
|1|egg, poached|
|1|sheet kombu-style seaweed (or 1oz shredded)|

### Instructions

* Soak seaweed and stems of mushrooms in water for 3-4 hours {or longer — start overnight or before you head out for work}. If you’re short on time or have a last minute craving you can soak for 30 minutes and then heat in a saucepan on low heat for 30 minutes.

* Remove seaweed. Add sliced caps of mushrooms and washed & sliced leeks. Simmer in a covered pot for 30 minutes-3 hours depending on how savory you want the broth and how much time you have.

* Boil 1-2 servings of soba noodles according to package instructions and add to broth. If you make extra store in a separate container so they don't get soggy in the fridge.

* Add mirin and soy sauce to taste. Add enough miso to cloud the broth. Top with chopped scallions.
