###Ingredients
|Quantity|Ingredient|
----------:|:-------
|2|cups unsweetened almond milk (alternatively, use sweetened vanilla almond milk and skip the agave and vanilla extract)|
|3 to 4|tablespoons agave nectar|
|1 1/2|teaspoons matcha powder|
|1/4|cup chia seeds|
|1|teaspoon vanilla extract|

###Instructions

* Whisk matcha powder, agave, and vanilla extract into the almond milk in a medium bowl. Mix in the chia seeds. Place bowl into the fridge to hang out for 1 hour, so the seeds chia-fy (the mixture should get thicker and more gelatinous).

* ZOOM: An hour has passed and now you have dino egg green chia glop in a bowl! Mix it up with a spoon to unclump the bigger bits. Divide the mixture between 4 molds. Wedge a wooden stick into each mold (the mixture will be thick enough that the stick will stand on it’s own). Freeze for three hours or overnight.

* Unmold and eat for breakfast because you can’t wait.
