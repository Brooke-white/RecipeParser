###Ingredients
|Quantity|Ingredient|
----------:|:-------
|2|tablespoons minced garlic|
|2|tablespoons minced ginger|
|4|teaspoons soy sauce|
||Salt|
|4|large eggs|
|2|cups thinly sliced leeks, white and light green parts only, rinsed and dried|
|4|cups cooked rice, preferably jasmine, at room temperature (see note below)|
|2|teaspoons sesame oil|
|1/2|cup peanut oil if you're Mark Bittman, chicken fat if you're Jean-Georges|

###Instructions

* In a large skillet, heat 1/4 cup oil over medium heat. Add garlic and ginger and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp and brown. With a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels and salt lightly. Alternately, you can pour the oil into a heat-proof bowl through a fine-mesh strainer, then return the flavorful oil to the pan, reserving the ginger and garlic bits.

* Reduce heat under skillet to medium-low and add 2 tablespoons oil and leeks. Cook about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until very tender but not browned. Season lightly with salt.

* Raise heat to medium and add rice. Cook, stirring well, until heated through. Season to taste with salt.

* In a nonstick skillet, fry eggs in remaining oil, sunny-side-up, until edges are set but yolk is still runny.

* Divide rice among four dishes. Top each with an egg and drizzle with 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil and 1 teaspoon soy sauce. Sprinkle crisped garlic and ginger over everything and serve.

* Note: Use leftover cooked rice if you have it. Here are some tips if you're cooking the rice fresh, to make sure it isn't too soggy: When the cook time is done, leave the rice undisturbed in the pot (uncovered) for 5 minutes. Spread the rice on a tray (or two) to dry out. While you prep the rest of the ingredients, put it by an open window or a fan, or pop the tray in the fridge or freezer if you have room. Jaden Hair at Steamy Kitchen also recommends starting with 1/4 to 1/3 less water when cooking the rice.
