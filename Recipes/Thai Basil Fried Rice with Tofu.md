----------:|:-------
|3|cups cooked rice, cooled|
|2|tablespoons vegetable oil|
|1|scallion, sliced on the bias|
|1/2|package firm tofu, cut into bite-sized pieces (1/2- to 1-inch)|
|1/2|cup fresh Thai basil|
|1|cup chopped red bell pepper|
|2|teaspoons finely diced white onion|

|1|tablespoon fish sauce|
|1 1/2|tablespoons granulated sugar|

###Instructions

* Start by smashing the garlic, chile peppers, and white onion for the sauce together until juices begin to run.

* Heat up a wok on high until smoking. Add in oil. Add the garlic, chile pepper, onion mix and stir immediately to prevent burning.

* Turn heat to medium and cook tofu for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring only occasionally, until browned. Flip and cook the other side.

* Add bell peppers and stir-fry for a few turns.

* Add the rest of the sauce ingredients (soy sauce through vegetable oil) and stir. When bell peppers are almost done, add in onion slices and stir fry for about 30 seconds, until onions are translucent but still have a crunch.

* Add in rice and stir until sauce and rice are well mixed.

* Taste-test and add more sugar or salt to your preference.

* Turn off heat and immediately stir in fresh Thai basil leaves.

* Top with a squeeze of lime juice and fresh scallions.
