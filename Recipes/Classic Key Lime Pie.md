### Instructions

* To make the pastry, in the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, salt, and sugar and pulse once to mix. Add the butter and shortening and process in short pulses to form pea-sized crumbs, 20 to 25 seconds. While pulsing, gradually add the water to form larger, moist crumbs, 10 seconds more. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and, with floured hands, shape the mixture into a flat disk. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or as long as overnight.
* To make the lime curd, in the top pan of a double boiler or in a nonreactive saucepan, whisk together the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, milk, and salt until blended. Then whisk in the lime juice. Set the top pan over the bottom pan of simmering water but not touching the water, or set the saucepan over medium-low heat. (If using a saucepan, take care not to heat the mixture to quickly). Cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spatula or spoon, until the mixture is warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes.
* Begin adding the butter a little at a time, stirring each addition until blended before adding more. Continue cooking, stirring constantly and scraping the bottom of the pan, until a finger drawn across the back of the spatula leaves a path, 8 to 10 minutes or more. Immediately remove the pan from the heat. Pass the curd through a chinois set over a nonreactive bowl and cool to room temperature.
* Position a rack in the center of an over and preheat to 425 degrees F. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry into a 12 inch round, about 1/8 inch thick. Transfer the dough to a 9-inch pie dish, fit the dough into the dish and trim the edges, leaving a Â½ inch overhang. Fold under the excess cough and, using your thumb, decoratively flute the edges.
* Line the bottom of the pie shell with parchment paper and fill the center with pie weights or dried beans. Bake for 12 minutes, then remove the parchment paper and weights. Continue baking until the pastry is golden and flaky, 10 to 12 minutes more. Transfer to a wire rack and cool 5 minutes.
* Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F. Pour the curd into the pie shell. Bake until the curd is set around the edges but still a little loose in the center, 20 to 25 minutes.
* Meanwhile, make the meringue: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites, vanilla, and cream of tartar on medium speed until soft peaks form, about 1 minute. Gradually add the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating on high speed until stiff, glossy peaks form, about 4 minutes more.
* Spread the meringue over the hot pie filling to the edges of the pastry to seal and prevent shrinkage. Bake until the top is golden, about 15 minutes. Transfer the pie to a wire rack and cool to room temperature, then refrigerate at least 4 hours before serving. Dip a knife in hot water to cut slices.
