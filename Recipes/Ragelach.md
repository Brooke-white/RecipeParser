### Ingredients
|Quantity|Ingredient|
----------:|:-------
|1|cup unsalted butter, softened|
|6|ounces cream cheese, softened|
|2 ¼|cup flour|
|1/2|cup sugar mixed with 1 ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon|
|3/4|cup raspberry jam or apricot preserves|
|3/4|cup raisins|
|1/2|cup walnuts|
### Instructions

* In a large bowl, beat butter and cream cheese with mixer on medium speed until smooth.
* On low speed, gradually add flour, beating just until dough comes together, 10-15 seconds. Divide dough into thirds, flattening each into a 6-inch disk.
* Wrap and refrigerate until firm enough to roll out, at least 1 hour or up to 1 week. (Or wrap airtight and freeze up to 2 months. Refrigerate until soft enough to roll).
* Preheat over to 350 degrees F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment or waxed paper for easy cleanup, if desired.
* Working quickly, generously sprinkle work surface and top of 1 disk of dough (keep others refrigerated) with flour. With a rolling pin, roll into a 14 inch circle.
* Remove and reserve 2 tablespoons cinnamon sugar. 
* Spread circle with ¼ cup jam or preserves, leaving a ¼ inch border, then sprinkle with 1/3 of the remaining cinnamon sugar, and 1/3 of the raisins and nuts.
* With a pizza cutter or knife, cut the circle into 16 wedges. Roll up wide ends to point; tuck point under. Sprinkle each with 1/8 teaspoon reserved cinnamon sugar. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.
* Place 2 inches apart on prepared cookie sheet. Bake 18-22 minutes, until bottoms are light brown and tops golden. Remove to a wire rack to cool.
* Storage tip: Store airtight at cool room temperature 1 week or freeze up to 3 months.
